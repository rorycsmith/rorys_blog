This is my first "real" blog entry in the sense that it isn't a test entry just to see if it's working or how it displays/formats.  
So what to **Actually** write about?  This is the point where playing with a new toy changes into confronting my own ability to create - and the point where I usually give up and look for some other Shiny New Object to engage me.  This is at least partly because I don't think most people care what I have to say - and this is certainly true.  But there are many blogs out there on a great diversity of topics expressing many crazy views.  So it can't hurt to try...    

How about a 'Thought for the Day'? Something to get the mental juices flowing.

### Thought for the Day:
#### The Entire Universe is a placebo effect.
Quickly that means that just as our belief in a drug or therapy can help or heal us manifests in our experience as becoming healed, our belief in a physical universe manifests as our experience of a physical universe.  More than that - how we imagine this world  to exist is based on mind that is colored by many layers of beliefs and habitual pattern.  This far more than just wishing or even believing you have a gold coin in your pocket.  To go deeper requires a lot of unpacking.  Actually, it requires a complete upending of how you view yourself, your mind, the universe and reality, but since we are just speculating, its fine.  
 
#### Lets start with defining what mind is.  
Imagine if you will *(key in the twilight zone music)* that you are a mind, a mind with no physicality (that's not that hard to imagine - just close your eyes and drift off - imagine no body, no space, just your thinking in isolation).  Physicality is just something that your mind dreams up, just as things seem real in your imagined dreams.  Imagine that this mind has always existed.  We could possibly refer to this mind as a proto-mind or a primordial mind that is more akin to a state of being or a state of awareness than anything physical.  **You could say this state of awareness is like a wave in a field of awareness.**  Just as the uncertainty principle gives rise to random fluctuations of energy and matter in space and time, these are random fluctuations of "intensity of awareness" in this field of awareness.  Just as subatomic particles are in reality, waves propagating through a "field of probabilities" (this is really no stranger than quantum field theory, its just a kind of 'quantum mind theory').  It is the very nature of waves to be both (apparently) separate things from each other while simultaneously part of a whole.  Aren't waves on the ocean really just a continuation of the ocean?  Where does one wave begin and the next end?

So think of this (your) proto-mind as a wave of awareness.  And just as the ocean is a multitude of interacting waves, think of your wave-mind as an extension of this ocean-mind and inter-related to all the other wave-minds.  It is not a truly independent entity nor are all the waves just "one".  There is an element of both separateness and of oneness. Just as the interactions of subatomic forces create a universe of endless diversity (or we could say that our perception of a universe of endless diversity results from infinite interactions of wave-minds) As the level of interactions increase in complexity so to does the perception of a complex world.  I would argue that the complexity we see in the world is a result of the complexity of the mind interactions.  Or that the physical world we percieve is a metaphor the wave 

another way of saying this is that we are **Dream Machines**.  As evidence I would offer our dream worlds that we all experience everynight.  Though everything in the dream is our creation, we act as if its not (we believe its not).
