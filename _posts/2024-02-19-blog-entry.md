This is my first "real" blog entry in the sense that it isn't a test entry just to see if it's working or how it displays/formats.  
So what to **Actually** write about?  This is the point where playing with a new toy changes into confronting my own ability to create - and the point where I usually give up and look for some other Shiny New Object to engage me.  This is at least partly because I don't think most people care what I have to say - and this is certainly true.  But there are many blogs out there on a great diversity of topics expressing many crazy views.  So it can't hurt to try...    


How about a 'Thought for the Day'? Something to get the mental juices flowing.



## Thought for the Day:

##### The Entire Universe is the placebo effect.  Or rather, your experience of the world is the placebo effect.
